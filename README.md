## 2048
Open-sourced game from Ania Kubow with refactored code for improving function readability and also keeping
color themes consistent and whatnot.

- Overall logic of game did not require any modification or refactoring
- Certain parts of the game logic may not be consistent with the officially released 2048 but logic was not modified in order to preserve
